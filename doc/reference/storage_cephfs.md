{abbr}`CephFS (Ceph File System)` is Ceph's file system component that provides a robust, fully-featured POSIX-compliant distributed file system.
Internally, it maps files to Ceph objects and stores file metadata (for example, file ownership, directory paths, access permissions) in a separate data pool.

## Terminology

```

A *CephFS file system* consists of two OSD storage pools, one for the actual data and one for the file metadata.

## `cephfs` driver in LXD

```{note}
The `cephfs` driver can only be used for custom storage volumes with content type `filesystem`.

For other storage volumes, use the {ref}`storage-ceph` driver.
That driver can also be used for custom storage volumes with content type `filesystem`, but it implements them through Ceph RBD images.
```

```{include} storage_ceph.md
    :start-after: <!-- Include start Ceph driver cluster -->
    :end-before: <!-- Include end Ceph driver cluster -->
```

You must create the CephFS file system that you want to use beforehand and specify it through the {ref}`source <storage-cephfs-pool-config>` option.

```{include} storage_ceph.md
    :start-after: <!-- Include start Ceph driver remote -->
    :end-before: <!-- Include end Ceph driver remote -->
```

% Include content from [storage_ceph.md](storage_ceph.md)
```{include} storage_ceph.md
    :start-after: <!-- Include start Ceph driver control -->
    :end-before: <!-- Include end Ceph driver control -->
```

The `cephfs` driver in LXD supports snapshots if snapshots are enabled on the server side.

## Configuration options

The following configuration options are available for storage pools that use the `cephfs` driver and for storage volumes in these pools.
